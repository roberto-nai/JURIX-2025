## Abstract

Legal and administrative sources often describe procedural steps that are not recorded in structured data, making them difficult to include in process mining analyses. In this work, we present an approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract events and dates from unstructured legal texts. The methodology is applied to a dataset of Italian procurement notices published since 2022 on the official EU platform, Tenders Electronic Daily (TED), demonstrating how LLMs can extract valuable information, such as administrative decisions adopted prior to tender publication. These extracted elements are incorporated into existing event logs, thereby enhancing the quality of process analysis. A sample of the extracted data has been manually reviewed by legal experts to assess the relevance and correctness of the automated detection. The results suggest that this approach can help identify procedural steps hidden in free text, thereby supporting more complete and accurate representations of legal workflows.

## Repository structure

- `res/` — resources and outputs
	- `event_extraction/` — input and processed CSVs, LLM outputs
	- `evaluation/` — annotation guidelines, samples and annotation spreadsheets
	- `preliminary_evaluation/` — gold standard and per-model prompt outputs (CSV/JSON)
	- `prompts/` — prompt templates (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, system prompt)

- `src/` — code and notebooks
	- `step1_data_preparation.ipynb` — data cleaning and CSV generation
	- `step2_llm_event_detection.ipynb` — prompt execution and result collection
	- `vars.py` — paths and configuration constants used by notebooks

---

## Quick start

1. Open the notebooks with Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
2. Run `step1_data_preparation.ipynb` to prepare data.
3. Run `step2_llm_event_detection.ipynb` to generate or process LLM outputs (API keys required if calling external models).

---

## Notes

- Files in `res/` are experimental outputs and may be overwritten by the notebooks.
- Use the annotation spreadsheets in `res/evaluation/` only after backing them up.
